The current project is created as a POC in an attempt to demonstrate how we can monitor the performance of the deployed ML models.

The project will provide an initial version of the following terms:
- **Data Drift** <br>
Concept drift is a phenomenon where the statistical properties of the _target variable_ have changed over time. 

- **Concept Drift** <br>
Concept drift is a phenomenon where the statistical properties of the _independent variables_ have changed have changed over time.

The packages that will be explored are: <br>
- [Evidenty AI](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently) 
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) 
- [Scikit-multiflow](https://scikit-multiflow.github.io/) 

For an extensive documentation in **model drift** please visit the dedicated [confluence](http://conf.europe.easyjet.local/display/DST/Model+Drift) page
